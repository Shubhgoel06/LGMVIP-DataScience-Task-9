## Handwritten Equation Solver

This repository contains a Python script that utilizes image processing and a trained neural network model to solve handwritten mathematical equations. The script takes an input image of a handwritten equation, processes it to recognize the equation components, and then evaluates the equation to provide the result.

## Introduction

Handwritten Equation Solver is a project that demonstrates the use of image processing and deep learning to recognize and solve handwritten mathematical equations. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify equation components and an evaluation mechanism to solve the equations.

## Features

- Recognizes handwritten mathematical symbols (+, -, *, digits)
- Evaluates handwritten equations
- Provides raw predictions and evaluated results

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (for neural network)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
